MoS Code Challenge #
Title of the project: WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE
The goal of this challenge is to practice JavaScript programming using HTML5 and CSS.
This was accomplished by using an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file.
The interaction of the HTML components with Control flow, functions, and object methods is made possible by producing an HTML file with the required tags, linking it with a CSS file that adds some styling to the background of my HTML, and using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
